Very much a work in progress

Issues:

Overlays:

- very unelegant solution, importing module.args/pkgsUnstable
  and the overlays from one file directly in the host config file

Gnome:

- keybindings conflict when switchen workspace
  -> <super + v>

KDE Plasma:

- workspace shortcuts need to be set manually
- splash screen is not disabled

Firefox:

- addon permissions need to be set manually
- ublock lists need to be set manually
- sync needs to be logged in manually

Vscode:

- Codeium ai plugin not working:

Dotfiles:

- Can't symlink dotfiles with hm for whatever reason
